## Overview

üåê TimeZoneInterceptor is a Java library for Spring Boot that provides automatic handling of timezone information in incoming HTTP requests. It allows you to extract and store the timezone from a custom header, making it easily accessible in your application's controller or service methods.

## Features

- ‚ú® Automatic extraction of timezone information from a custom header in incoming requests.
- üßµ Stores the timezone information in a `ThreadLocal` variable, accessible within the same request thread.
- üöÄ Seamless integration with Spring Boot applications.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable header to change where it looks for timezone

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your project's `pom.xml` to use TimeZoneInterceptor:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.dineshsolanki</groupId>
    <artifactId>TimeZoneInterceptor</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

TimeZoneInterceptor is available on Maven Central.

## Usage

### 1. Configuration

By default, TimeZoneInterceptor expects the timezone information to be provided in the `X-TimeZone` header of incoming requests. You can customize the header name by adding the following property to your `application.properties`:

```properties
time-zone-interceptor.header-name=Your-Custom-TimeZone-Header
```

### 2. Accessing the Timezone

In your Spring Boot application's controller or service methods, you can access the timezone information using the `TimeZoneInterceptor.getTimeZone()` method:

```java
import io.github.dineshsolanki.TimeZoneInterceptor;

@RestController
public class YourController {

    @GetMapping("/your-endpoint")
    public ResponseEntity<String> yourEndpoint() {
        TimeZone timeZone = TimeZoneInterceptor.getTimeZone();
        // Your logic using the timeZone information
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Endpoint executed with timezone: " + timeZone.getID());
    }
}
```

### 3. Spring Boot Auto-Configuration (Optional)

TimeZoneInterceptor automatically registers the interceptor in Spring Boot applications using Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature. You don't need to explicitly configure the interceptor.

### 4. Interceptor Removal

The library automatically cleans up the `ThreadLocal` storage after the request is processed. You don't need to worry about manual cleanup.
